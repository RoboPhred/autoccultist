# While this lets us kick in if we do not have cards for all 3 recipes, this is totally fine for this situation,
# since this situation loops each recipe until satisfied.
# There are two possible failure modes this fixes:
# - The operation might already be ongoing when the bot starts (from a save file, for example)
#   In this case, the lore/secrethistories will be already stored, and not available on the table, blocking us from running.
# - reason or a recruit might not be available by the time we want it, causing the operation to quit.  We want the operation
#   to kick back in when the missing card is available.
