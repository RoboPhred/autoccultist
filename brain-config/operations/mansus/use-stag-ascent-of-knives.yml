      # The Stag Door has a bug where the face-down card can be predicted 99% of the time.
      # influenceforgec indicates that the face-down card in mansus_stagdoor1 is influencewintere.
      # Winter influences eventually decay into Dread, so we're better off without it.
      # (The card for mansus_stagdoor2 would be an Erudition lesson, but we can't tell it to grab that one.)
