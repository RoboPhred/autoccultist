    # We originally had goals latch on when they became active (or rather, not care about requirements at all)
    # This meant that this goal could declare its 3 reason textbook requirement and it would keep running
    # even as it consumed the text books and its requirements dropped back into 'not-met'.
    # However, currently, we keep zero state about goals, and if the requirements drop off and the motivation is deferring to the goals,
    # then consuming our textbooks will cause requirements to fail and stop the motivation cold.
    # To try to work around this, we need to include all our interim states in our requirements.
    # I'm not sure how this will work out with the tight timing of eruditionplus decay...
