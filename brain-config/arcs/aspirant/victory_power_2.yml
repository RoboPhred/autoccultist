# Ideas for More Faster
# - Stop looking for followers earlier.  We only need a few as sacrifices for the spider door
#     Teach it to look for followers only when it runs low?
#     Spider door deck has a fixed number of draws before refresh, so we only need that many followers.
# - Indoctrinate followers as-needed for spider door sacrifices?
#     We use talk to delay Crucible decaying, so we will need to juggle that with talk to indoctrinate...
# - Don't buy things we don't need from oriflamme.

# Note: Getting close to loosing games due to lack of money.  Multi tasking strategy seems to take longer to get out of junior position so it bleeds money.
# As it is, rng can kill it from getting too many sicknesses or dreads, forcing it to burn money to satisfy them.
# Should look into rushing high passion and using painting.
