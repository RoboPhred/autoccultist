- Operations and imperatives should automatically get a name based on the yaml file and line they were defined on
- BrainConfig validation should be implemented alongside the yaml parser to capture the file and line number
  - There is an example of this in the YamlDotNet github
- Either make all data come from IGameState, or get rid of it completely.
  - We are still going to need something to handle reserved cards. Maybe IGameState can have a list of unreserved or unconsumed cards and a method to reserve / consume them.
- If the game isnt in 'game mode', dont update stuff.
- If the game transitions out of game mode, lobotomize the brain and other states.
- More robust yaml parsing: Record errors and cleanly display to user
  - Particulary care about what yaml file the error came from, can be multiple files in play due to !import
- extends property of imperatives should also be able to take a filename and auto-load that from the imperatives folder
- imperativeSets property of goals should also be able to take a filename and auto-load that from the imperative-sets folder
- Many (but not all) goals will have a common set of imperatives, we should find a way to share these.
